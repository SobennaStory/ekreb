Hello. This is the EKREB game created by Sobenna Onwumelu
sobenna.p.onwumelu@vanderbilt.edu

To run this program you need the following dependencies

    "antd": "^5.9.2",
    "axios": "^1.5.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-confetti": "^6.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-particles": "^2.12.2",
    "react-tsparticles": "^2.12.2"

    e.g npm install "react-tsparticles"

npm install [package] with the package's name being substituted should suffice. E.g npm install antd

To play the game, start the backend by navigating to backend folder in a terminal and running [node index.js]
start the frontend by navigating to frontend-sob and running [npm run dev].

From there you should be gravy.

I think ekreb might be breek? I don't know, its an enigma. It makes the title better if you don't know I think...


My project was a bit overzealous graphhically. I feel like I overloaded my game.jsx and by the time I realized it it was too hard to seperate the code 
so I made the issue worse by adding more. I had fun creating it as you may notice.

There are a few easter eggs like random tool tips on a succesful guess and a word to input and instantly 'win', but overall I followed quite closely
to the suggested formats. I had a lot of fun making this and I hope anyone reading has fun playing.
